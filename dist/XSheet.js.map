[CCBY2] see http://danml.com/download.html for tests/usage\r\n// v1 landed a FF+Chrome compat way of downloading strings to local un-named files, upgraded to use a hidden frame and optional mime\r\n// v2 added named files via a[download], msSaveBlob, IE (10+) support, and window.URL support for larger+faster saves than dataURLs\r\n// v3 added dataURL and Blob Input, bind-toggle arity, and legacy dataURL fallback was improved with force-download mime and base64 support. 3.1 improved safari handling.\r\n// v4 adds AMD/UMD, commonJS, and plain browser support\r\n// v4.1 adds url download capability via solo URL argument (same domain/CORS only)\r\n// v4.2 adds semantic variable names, long (over 2MB) dataURL support, and hidden by default temp anchors\r\n// https://github.com/rndme/download\r\n\r\n(function (root, factory) {\r\n  if (typeof define === 'function' && define.amd) {\r\n    // AMD.
